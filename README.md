How to play the game:
Navigate your character around the map and attempt to avoid the caster minion. If you hit it, 
it triggers a turn based combat fight where you must defeat the opponent. 
After defeating/avoiding the minion you reach the enemy nexus and win.

Keys/Mouse input:
Arrow keys for movement, mouse for selecting attacks and clicking through screens.

Cheat Keys:
Spacebar: immediately triggers a battle in the walking portion of the game
Enter: brings the enemy down to 1hp in the battle portion of the game

Known bugs:
If you choose an attack before the previous attack finishes its animation,
the previous attack with freeze and not leave the screen.
It is possible to attack very quickly and kill the enemy before it gets a chance to 
attack back. 

Extra features:

Impressions/Suggestions:
Really fun but also really difficult because we weren't given a lot to start out with.
Wish there had been some more explanation of how to use JavaFX
