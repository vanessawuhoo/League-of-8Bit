The genre of my game is RPG with turn based combat portions. 
The name is League of 8Bit. 
The goal is to defeat or avoid several enemy champions in order to reach the enemy nexus, which is the win condition.
The enemies can be avoided, allowing the player to proceed to the next screen without triggering a combat portion. However,
if the character collides with an enemy, a battle will be triggered. If the player loses the battle it's game over. 
The character moves around with arrow keys. Selections in combat mode are also made with the arrow keys and spacebar. The
spacebar will also make dialogue progress.
The modes differ in that one is RPG style where you control a main character and make them walk around. The other mode
is a turn based combat mode where you must fight an enemy champion.
