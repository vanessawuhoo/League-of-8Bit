The genre of my game is RPG with turn based combat portions. 
The name is 
The goal is to defeat or avoid 5 enemy champions in order to reach the enemy nexus, which is the win condition.
The character moves around with arrow keys. Selections in combat mode are also made with the arrow keys and spacebar. The
spacebar will also make dialogue progress.
The modes differ in that one is RPG style where you control a main character and make them walk around. The other mode
is a turn based combat mode where you must fight an enemy champion.
